# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
Hello, this is my first project using HTML, CSS, SASS and Bootsrap. The web title is Webstore, and is located in a folder called WebStore as well. It contains 5 html files with an index page and other 4 pages with content. The index page is a landing page, and the others are pages where you can see a list of different products and a form to submit. I used Sass for the css stylesheet, creating the stylesheet-webstore.scss file compilating the css file with an equal name. I tried to include all the requirements that the project0 asked for, so I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks.
