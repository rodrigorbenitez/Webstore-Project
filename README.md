# Web Store front-end project

This is my first project using HTML, CSS, SASS and Bootsrap. The web title is Webstore, and is located in a folder called WebStore as well. It contains 5 html files with an index page and other 4 pages with content. The index is a landing page, and  in the others pages  you can see a list of different products and a submit form. I used Sass for the css stylesheet, creating the stylesheet-webstore.scss file compilating the css file with an equal name.

## Getting Started

Start by either downloading the zip file or clone with HTTPS.

### Prerequisites

A modern web-browser like Safari, Chrome, Microsoft-Edge, Mozilla Firefox, etc.

### Running

Double-click the "index.html" file after unzipping the downloaded zip file.
